Since Linux uses the inotify package to observe filesystem events, individual files or directories.
React / Angular hot-reloads and recompiles files on save it needs to keep track of all project's files. Increasing the inotify watch limit should hide the warning messages.

# insert the new value into the system config
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p

# check that the new value was applied
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches

# config variable name (not runnable)
fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288


kill a localhost process in ubantu
sudo kill -9 $(sudo lsof -t -i:port_number)


when should the axios interceptors be ejected 
Eject interceptor
axios.interceptors.response.eject(interceptor); <---- What does this do

Internally, interceptors.response is an array of interceptors, the method axios.interceptors.response.use return the id of the new interceptor. Calling eject passing the id of the interceptor will set the corresponding item in the array to null, and the interceptor has no effect anymore.

When we receive the response code 401, we use the interceptor to send another request to get the token. To avoid the infinity loop if the latter also receives the response code 401, we eject the interceptor in this case.

Resend original request
return axios(error.response.config); <--- what does this do

After receiving the token, we want to resend the original request, its configuration is stored in error.response.config according to the response schema

To use the function, call it before sending the request. (People talk about it in the thread of the accepted answer.)
